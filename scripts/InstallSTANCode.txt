# Using the guide on the github page for RStan
# https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

# 1.
# Start off with the installation of rtools42, STAN is picky
# about the version history unfortunately. Also have it install
# directly to the "C:/" drive on a PC.
# Link:
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html

# 2. 
# Now we need to install the packages needed, STAN is kind of picky about the
# version needed to actually get this working so using the regular install
# option should be avoided.

# The documentation recommends uninstalling old versions first
remove.packages("rstan")
if (file.exists(".RData")) file.remove(".RData")

cat("Please restart R!") # You need to restart R


# Install the StanHeaders Package
install.packages("StanHeaders",
                 repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/",
                           getOption("repos")))

# Install rstan
install.packages("rstan",
                 repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/",
                           getOption("repos")))


# Install the other packages recommended to go with this
install.packages(c("gdata", "bayesplot"))


# Example case to check that it installed properly
library("rstan")
example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE)

# The warning:
# "
# Warning message:
# In system(paste(CXX, ARGS), ignore.stdout = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE) :
# 'C:/rtools40/usr/mingw_/bin/g++' not found
# "
# Is safe to ignore, they should patch it out eventually.
